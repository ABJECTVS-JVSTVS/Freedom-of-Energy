# Freedom-of-Energy
This is an open-source project dedicated to the implementation of a novel marina hydroelectric system. Our goal is to create an economical, renewable, and rapid method of energy production by harnessing the power of ocean water pressure.
## Project Overview                                                                                                                The system works by utilizing high-pressure water that enters through a nozzle into a submerged pipe. The water flows through a generator, then rises until its pressure drops drastically. At this point, the water makes a 90Â° turn downward into a receiver where there is positive pressure, causing the water to discharge efficiently.
## Objectives                                                                                                                        - Develop and prototype the marine hydroelectric system.                                                                            - Document the process and results thoroughly.                                                                                      - Encourage community collaboration and contributions.
