# Freedom-of-Energy
This is an open-source project dedicated to the implementation of a novel marina hydroelectric system. 
Our goal is to create an economical, renewable, and rapid method of energy production by harnessing the power of ocean water pressure.
## Project Overview                                                                                                          
The system works by utilizing high-pressure water that enters through a nozzle into a submerged pipe. The water flows through a generator, then rises until its pressure drops drastically. At this point, the water makes a 90° turn downward into a receiver where there is positive pressure, causing the water to discharge efficiently.
## Objectives                                                                                                                 
Develop and prototype the marine hydroelectric system.                                                                           
Document the process and results thoroughly.                                                                                     
Encourage community collaboration and contributions.

## Notes: An Alien's Plea

Greetings, Earthlings! I am an anonymous alien who watches with concern as my meager monetary resources slip through my fingers I teach history, so is not much. Due to extra-galactic laws, I can't interfere directly in human affairs. So, after much thoughtful consideration, I’m here to propose a game.

The purpose of this game is to maximize the purchasing power of the money we already have, avoiding the extravagances of your economic system. Hence, I propose we work together on the "Freedom of Energy" project. This project can provide us with a low-cost, quickly implementable energy source, capable of delivering vast amounts of energy to specific regions.

By producing locally with extremely cheap energy—let's talk 1970s prices—we can produce high-quality products at minimal cost, eliminating the need to import low-quality, short-lived goods from overseas. This approach will create local jobs and revitalizes industry, effectively turning back the clock to an era of more sensible pricing.

The strategy of the game is to implement this marine hydroelectric system to reduce production costs, improve quality, and align operational costs with those of the 1970s. One rule of our game is that we cannot interfere with the financial or political systems. Therefore, our strategy is to implement this system transparently, with real prices, ensuring that politicians have no choice but to help their people.

Our goal is to make this system production-ready so that we can petition our local leaders to implement it through what you call democracy. This system is for the people, not for dim-witted rulers who break promises and impose taxes indiscriminately via a financial system that doesn’t protect our purchasing power. This is the essence of the book "E.T. Learns to Count." Let's strive to boost our local purchasing power to 1970s standards, without any funny business with the currency. Hehehehe!
