# System Architecture

## Overview
The system architecture of "Freedom of Energy" describes the high-level structure of the hydroelectric energy generation system. It includes the main components, their interactions, and the data flow within the system.

## Components
- **Inlet Nozzle**: The entry point for high-pressure water.
- **Submerged Pipe**: The conduit through which water flows towards the generator.
- **Generator**: Converts kinetic energy of the water into electrical energy.
- **Pressure Drop Curve**: A section where the pressure of water drops significantly.
- **Outlet Receiver**: Collects water after it passes through the generator.
- **Positive Pressure Zone**: Facilitates the discharge of water.

## Interaction Between Components
1. **Water Inlet**: High-pressure water enters the system through the inlet nozzle.
2. **Energy Generation**: Water flows through the submerged pipe and turns the generator.
3. **Pressure Management**: The pressure drop curve reduces water pressure.
4. **Water Discharge**: Water exits the system via the outlet receiver into a positive pressure zone.
