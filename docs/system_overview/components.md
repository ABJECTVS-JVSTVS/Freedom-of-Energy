# System Components

## Inlet Nozzle
- **Description**: The nozzle through which high-pressure water enters the system.
- **Function**: Directs water into the submerged pipe efficiently.
- **Specifications**: Material, size, flow rate.

## Submerged Pipe
- **Description**: A pipe submerged in water that guides water to the generator.
- **Function**: Ensures smooth flow of water towards the generator.
- **Specifications**: Length, diameter, material.

## Generator
- **Description**: A device that converts kinetic energy from water into electrical energy.
- **Function**: Generates electricity as water flows through it.
- **Specifications**: Power output, efficiency, type.

## Pressure Drop Curve
- **Description**: A section where the pressure of water is reduced.
- **Function**: Manages the pressure of water to optimize generator performance.
- **Specifications**: Angle, length.

## Outlet Receiver
- **Description**: The end point where water exits the system.
- **Function**: Collects water post-generation and discharges it into a positive pressure zone.
- **Specifications**: Size, discharge rate.

## Positive Pressure Zone
- **Description**: An area where water is collected and pressure is maintained positively.
- **Function**: Assists in the smooth discharge of water.
- **Specifications**: Pressure level, volume.
