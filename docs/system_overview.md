# System Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the marine hydroelectric system proposed in the "Freedom of Energy" project.

## System Components
- **Nozzle**: High-pressure water entry point.
- **Submerged Pipe**: Conveys water through the system.
- **Generator**: Converts the kinetic energy of water into electricity.
- **Receiver**: Collects and discharges the water efficiently.

## Working Principle
The system works by utilizing high-pressure water that enters through a nozzle into a submerged pipe. The water flows through a generator, then rises until its pressure drops drastically. At this point, the water makes a 90° turn downward into a receiver where there is positive pressure, causing the water to discharge efficiently.
